# Eye-State-Detection

## Running the pretrained model
For running the pretrained model just use the following command. You can also change the image path by 
going to the file. Use the follwing command to run our model.

```
python3 model.py
```

## Preparing the Model
For preparing the model from scratch you need to follow the following steps-

1. Go to this Google drive [link](# Eye-State-Detection

## Preparing the Model
For preparing the model from scratch you need to follow the following steps-

1. Go to this Google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1I6t3FNLm8uSehRAcN6KbM3d-vpgRFnrQ) and download all the files and folders
2. Follow the following discussion-

## Dataset Creation
For creating the dataset you need to make sure that the mrlEyes_2018_01 directory and the preprocess-data.py 
file are in the same directory. You can also resolve the path in preprocess-data.py file also.
Use the following command to run the preprocessing step.

```
python3 preprocess-data.py
```

## Training the model
For training make sure you have the train-model.py, X_train.np, y_train.np, X_val.np, and y_val.np are under the same 
directory. Then use the following command to run the training.

```
python3 train-model.py
```

## Testing the model
For testing make sure you have the test-model.py, X_test.np, and y_test.np are under the same 
directory. Then use the following command to run the testing.

```
python3 test-model.py
```) and download all the files and folders
